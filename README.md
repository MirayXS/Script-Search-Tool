# Script-Search-Tool
This is a great tool for script developers who want to be able to make scripts using a decompiler, while being able to view and filter out scripts with certain functions and keywords.

If you get any errors, please contact me or fill out an issue in this repo. I won't be able to solve the issue unless I am communicated with about it.

**Features:**
- Filter out scripts by their contents.
- Reset, clear, and refresh scripts at the ease of a few buttons
- Copy code on-the-fly, with our built in copy button in our script viewer.
- Sleek GUI!
- It decompiles everything first, so that you can easily swap between scripts unlike Dex where you have to often wait for it to finish decompiling every script.
- Save everything to one easy to access folder, allowing you to edit scripts in a program like VSCode.
